introduction
I Build a smart trashcan called the BinBot. One of the components of this BinBot is that it opens when there is movement detected within 20 cm of the lid.
After the lid opened, the camera with smart ai will check in which bin the trash has to be sorted (for example: plastic or paper) the bin in which it is supposed to be in will light up. The component we are building today is connecting the ledstrip to the motion detection.

In this manual we are going to make a led strip light up green when someone is moving 20 cm from a movement sensor using arduino.

Make sure arduino is already installed on your laptop.
If you haven't done this, use this manual: ////////
To install Node MCU use this manual: ////////

required hardware components:
- arduino ide
- node MCU
- ledstrip
- movement sensor
- laptop
- wires

## step 1: connecting the led strip
To install the led strip, first plug in your arduino in your laptop and open the arduino IDE 2 app. 

### 1. the physical plugs
there will be 3 wires connected to the LED. U will see the following text.

**+5v** this is the power source
**Din** this stands for a digital signal
**GND** Stands for Groud

connect the +5v to the 3V3 on arduino
connect

### 2. installing the led and running it
   
## step 2: changing the color
## step 3: connecting the momevement sensor
## step 4: adding code
## step 5: changing the distance
## errors
## sources
